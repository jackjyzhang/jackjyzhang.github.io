I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/) majoring in Computer Science, Mathematics, Applied Mathematics and Statistics, and minoring economics.



My research interest lies in the area of Natural Language Processing, especially on topics in *NLP for social media* and *controlled text generation*. I have been working as a research assistant at the Center for Language and Speech Processing at Johns Hopkins University supervised by [Mark Dredze](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~mdredze/) and [Benjamin Van Durme](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~vandurme/index.html). I'm also a research assistant at MIT CSAIL working with [Jim Glass](http://people.csail.mit.edu/jrg/) and [Tianxing He](https://people.csail.mit.edu/cloudygoose/).
