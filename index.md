I am a CS PhD student at the [Center for Language and Speech Processing](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/), [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/), advised by [Daniel Khashabi](https://danielkhashabi.com/) and [Benjamin Van Durme](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~vandurme/index.html).

I completed my undergrad degree also from [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/) majoring in Computer Science, Mathematics, Applied Mathematics and Statistics, and minoring in Economics. GO HOP! üíôü§ç

My research interest lies in the area of Natural Language Processing, particularly on topics related to the safety and trustworthiness of foundation models. In the past, I have collaborated with [Mark Dredze](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~mdredze/) at JHU CLSP, [Yulia Tsvetkov](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yuliats/) and [Tianxing He](https://people.csail.mit.edu/cloudygoose/) at the University of Washington, and [Jim Glass](http://people.csail.mit.edu/jrg/) at MIT CSAIL.

## Teaching

I was a course assistant for [EN.601.465/665: Natural Language Processing](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason/465/), taught by [Jason Eisner](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason), in Fall 2022 and Fall 2021.

I was a section leader for [Code in Place](https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/) 2021, hosted by Stanford University.
